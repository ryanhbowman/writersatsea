            <p class="big">The At Sea residency programme aims to provide a quiet, and quietly inspiring, place for writers to concentrate solely on reading, thinking and writing without the distractions and pressures of the everyday. Writing is an endeavour that rewards persistence, time and concentration. At Sea hopes spectacular sunsets, a vibrant seaside culture and, above all, space will help.</p>

            <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            <p>You will have full run of a two-bedroom, two-bathroom Grade-II-listed flat in Margate&lsquo;s old Fort Lodge hotel, built in 1823. The flat is at the top of a majestic sprial staircase and is filled with hundreds of books for both reference and fun. There is a fully stocked kitchen and you will be provided, of course, with bedding and towels. <small style="font-size: .8em; opacity: .9; display:block;">>NB: Unfortunately there is no lift in the building so, regrettably, the residency is not suitable for writers with mobility issues.</small> </p>

            <h2>Stipend</h2>
            <p>As well as having private access to a peaceful seafront apartment, the successful applicant will be given a £250 stipend in cash. This should be enough to cover food for the week, as well as a little local sightseeing for inspiration. If you are travelling to Margate by train, we can also pay £50 towards your train fare.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Dates</h2>
            <p>The inaugural At Sea residency will run from Saturday 17 November 2018 to Sunday 25 November 2018. This first residency is open to novel writers. The second installment will run from Saturday 9 March 2019 to Sunday 17 March 2019, and will be open to playwrights.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
            <p>If you are under 30 and you write, you are eligible to apply for At Sea. However, the theme of the residency will change each time: the first residency (in November 2018) is open to anyone under 30 who is working on a novel; the second (in March 2019) will be open to anyone under 30 who is working on a play. (Poets, memoirists, graphic novelists, screenwriters, biographers, essayists &ndash; your time will come!) </p>
            <p>You don&lsquo;t need to be &lsquo;established&rsquo; in your writing career, or have been published: we are looking for promising, passionate writers who will relish a week of solitude to devote to their work. We do expect that you have put some time and energy into your writing already though, so we ask for a short excerpt from the work you plan on honing while you are in Margate.</p>
            <p>We especially welcome applications from writers from diverse or lower-income backgrounds.</p>

            <h2>Application Process</h2>
            <p>We would like to read a sample of your writing &ndash; ideally the project you plan to work on during the residency. We also want to hear about you: please provide a few paragraphs about yourself, your background, your creative interests, and why At Sea would be helpful to you.</p>
