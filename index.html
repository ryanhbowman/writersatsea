          <p>Two, one-week residencies for young, British writers in Margate. Recipients will have use of a historic two bedroom seaside flat in Margate as well as a £250 bursary towards food and £50 towards train travel.</p>
          <p>Each year of the residency is themed, with the inaugural theme being very general – novel-writing. Applicants should be in the midst of a novel and will need to submit 15,000 words plus a synopsis with their application. Think of the residency as a momentum builder rather than a firestarter.</p>
