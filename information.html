            <p>Two, one-week residencies for young, British writers in Margate. Recipients will have use of a historic two bedroom seaside flat in Margate as well as a £250 bursary towards food and £50 towards train travel.</p>
            <h2>Accomodation</h2>
            <p>Each year of the residency is themed, with the inaugural theme being very general – novel-writing. Applicants should be in the midst of a novel and will need to submit 15,000 words plus a synopsis with their application. Think of the residency as a momentum builder rather than a firestarter.</p>

            <h2>Stipend</h2>
            <p>As well as having private access to a peaceful seafront apartment, the successful applicant will be given a #250 stipend in cash. This should be enough to cover food for the week, as well as a little local sightseeing for inspiration. If you are travelling to Margate by train, we can also pay #50 towards your train fare.</p>

            <h2>Dates</h2>
            <p>The inaugural Writers at Sea will run from Saturday 17 November 2018 to Sunday 25 November 2018. This first residency will be open to novel writers. The second installment will run from Saturday 9 March 2019 to Sunday 17 March 2019, and will be open to playwrights.</p>

            <h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
            <p>If you are under 30 and you write, you are eligible to apply for At Sea. However, the theme of the residency will change each time: the first residency (in November 2018) will be open to anyone under 30 who is working on a novel; the second (in March 2019) is open to anyone under 30 who is working on a play. (Poets, memoirists, graphic novelists, screenwriters, biographers, essayists - your time will come!) </p>
            <p>You don't need to be 'established' in your career, or have been published - we are looking for promising, passionate writers who will relish a week of solitude to devote to their work.
            <p>We especially welcome applications from writers from diverse or lower-income backgrounds.</p>

            <h2>Application Process</h2>
            <p>We would like to read a sample of your writing - ideally the project you plan to work on during the residency. We also want to hear about you: please provide a few paragraphs about yourself, your background, your creative interests, and why At Sea would be helpful to you.</p>
